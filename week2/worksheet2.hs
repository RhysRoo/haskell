Q1a) sumThree 3 5 7

step 0 - The function will scan through the fuction looking for any partenthies as the instruction within this
must be run first. if none are found in this case it will begin at the start again.

step 1 - 3 is seen as its the first visable input of the function

step 2 - after 3 has been seen. the function will run the next instruction which is the addition operator

step 3 - after the addition operator the function will look at what to value to add to this operator 
which is 5 so 3 + 5 will be added together and returned as the provisional result, but will keep going until
the code has cleared. 

step 4 - another addition operator

step 5 - result (3 + 5  = 8) + the next value which is 7

step 6 = 8 + 7 will be executed which returns a provisional reslut of 15

step 7 - are there anymore instrustructs? no

step 8 - return the provisional result as output

Q1b) sumThree 8 (1 + 3) 2
